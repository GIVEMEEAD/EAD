This is a tool that built to help add history view of a video that indicate how international students are suffering with their OPT applications. There is a severe delay of OPT applicants who submit their application to Dallas lockbox after 2020-10-29. Few of them received recepit of their application even they have waited for more than 80 days. F-1 students are not allowed to submit OPT application after 60 days of their graduation. But USCIS's delay leads to the impossibility of new submission of OPT if someone's OPT application is denied. They need to be deported immediately after their grace period which is near 2021-02-10. It's obvious that the delay caused by USCIS leads to the deportation of OPT applicants. So we want our voice to be heard. That's the reason why this project exist.
